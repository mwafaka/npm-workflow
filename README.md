# Gain practical experience with npm workflow, module management

In this exercise, you will gain practical experience with npm workflow and module management. Follow the instructions below:

## Instructions:

1. Setting up the project:

   - Create a new directory for your project.
   - Initialize a new npm project using the command `npm init`.
   - Install the following modules as dependencies:
     - "uuid" for generating unique identifiers
     - "moment" for date manipulation
   - Create an HTML file and a JavaScript file in your project directory.

2. Module management:

   - In your JavaScript file, import the "uuid" module and use it to generate a unique identifier.
   - In the same JavaScript file, import the "moment" module and use it to manipulate a date object.

3. Dependency list:

   - Examine the `package.json` file in your project directory.
   - Identify the dependencies section and note down the modules you installed in step 1.
   - Differentiate between the dependencies and devDependencies sections.

Your task is to follow these instructions and complete the exercise using the "uuid" package. Good luck!
